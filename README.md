In the National Lottery, players pick 6 numbers between 1 and 59. Six unique random balls are then output, together with a “bonus ball”. Prizes are awarded for matching 2, 3, 4, 5, 5 and the bonus ball or 6 numbers. Write a program to simulate the National Lottery, outputting from 1,000,000 draws how many times the player won each of the prizes. Use your program to prove the odds of winning the jackpot of 6 numbers is 1 : 45,057,474.
