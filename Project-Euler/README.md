#Largest palindrome product

##prob4.py

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

Let σ(n) be the sum of the divisors of n
E.g. the divisors of 4 are 1, 2 and 4, so σ(4)=7  

The numbers n not exceeding 20 such that 7 divides σ(n) are: 4,12,13 and 20, the sum of these numbers being 49. 

Let S(n,d) be the sum of the numbers i not exceeding n such that d divides σ(i)
So S(20,7)=49 

You are given: S(10^6, 2017)=150850429 and S(10^9, 2017)=249652238344557

Find S(10^11, 2017)

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
